- ðŸ‘‹ Hi , I am a little coder interested in playing 
With my codes with in my limited knowledge of
Coding in c,c++,java,c#,vb.net,php,javascript
Etc and even though I am not interested in deeper 
Knowledge on these things , I am trying to build
Some waste of time activities .
Currently I am trying to build a php library that 
Allows easy coding of front end and back end part 
For building websites (not a giant stylish) like
For the purpose accounting or any such solution based 
Websites  
I think my library must easy to use and at least 
I can use it for building other websites without 
Any IDE ... The library of mine will help users
To build any type of websites with pure php
And php has the power to do this (I mean javascript
And html are used in library but users need not to study 
Such stuff by this library).
